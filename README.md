## 📚 Course Overview

In this course, students will:

- Understand the difference between generative and discriminative models.
- Explore core concepts like probability distributions, likelihood, and sampling.
- Implement and train generative models such as Autoencoders, Variational Autoencoders, and GANs.
- Use modern frameworks like **TensorFlow** and **PyTorch** to build and experiment with generative models.
- Learn about the impact and ethical considerations of generative AI in real-world applications.

📌 Note to Students
This course combines theory with implementation. Ensure you practice code regularly and participate in discussions. All models you learn here are used in real-world AI systems powering text generation, deepfakes, music creation, and more.

Let’s build smart machines that create!
